                <p>The research was conducted with 3 applications using SWOT profile and 4 main features.</p>

                <h3>Key Discoveries</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unable to find apps that cover all the features.</li>
                        <li>R.W.L houses all your health activity apps in one place, but it lacks any medical features.</li>
                        <li>Ornament digitizes and stores lab results and provides reliable scientific resources using a simple and easy-to-understand platform.</li>
                        <li>Moody Months &apos; UI is personable and the overall approach is similar to what DesignPath is aiming for.</li>

DesignPath hopes to widen the age demographic gradually to anyone above 16 to 70+ women who have regular health check-ups.</p>
